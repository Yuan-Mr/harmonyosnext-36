### 【Sharing】Hidden Treasures of HarmonyOS Development! Hands-On "One-Develop-Multi-Deploy" Practical Skills!  

Hello everyone~ Today, while browsing HarmonyOS developer documentation, I discovered a super practical collection of "one-develop-multi-deploy" cases! It turns out the official team has long prepared various cross-device adaptation solutions—it's like discovering a new continent! I quickly organized and shared several ultra-practical mobile payment development cases to help you avoid detours~  


### I. The Magic of Interface Layout: Grid System  
#### 1. Transformation of the Diamond Zone  
- Mobile: Circular icons + vertical text  
- Large screen: Rounded rectangles + horizontal layout  

**Key code**:  
```typescript  
GridRow({gutter: {x: {sm:30, md:41, lg:58}}}) {  
  ForEach(this.quickFunctions, (item) => {  
    GridCol({span:3}) {  
      // Switch component form based on screen size  
      this.curBp === 'sm' ?  
        <CircleComponent> : <RectangleComponent>  
    }  
  })  
}  
```  
**Practical tip**: Use `GridCol.span` to control element proportion, combined with breakpoint listening for "intelligent typesetting".  

#### 1. 72 Transformations of Function Entries  
- 4 columns on mobile → 6 columns on tablet → 8 columns on PC  

**Secret weapon**: Dynamic configuration of `columns` attribute  
```typescript  
GridRow({  
  columns: {sm:4, md:6, lg:8}, // Magic numbers here!  
  gutter: {x:{sm:45, md:50, lg:55}}  
})  
```  


### II. Cross-Device Secrets of Payment and Receipt  
(With pop-up and full-screen page switching schematics)  

#### 1. Intelligent device size judgment:  
```typescript  
private receivePayment() {  
  if (this.curBp === 'sm') {  
    // Jump to a new page on mobile  
    router.pushUrl({url:'ReceivePaymentPage'})  
  } else {  
    // Display pop-up on large screens  
    this.isDialogOpen = true  
  }  
}  
```  

#### 1. Pitfalls and solutions for dynamic QR codes:  
```typescript  
// Timed refresh logic  
aboutToAppear() {  
  this.timer = setInterval(() => {  
    this.getNewQRCode() // Call API to update  
  }, 60000)  
}  

// Must remember to clear!  
aboutToDisappear() {  
  clearInterval(this.timer)  
}  
```  
**Pitfall prevention**: Remember to listen for breakpoint changes when folding large screens to avoid layout confusion!  


### III. Cross-Device Adaptation for Scan Functions  
#### 1. Adaptive camera area:  
```typescript  
// Achieve responsiveness through percentages  
Scanner({  
  width: '70%',  
  height: '70%',  
  aspectRatio: 1 // Force 1:1 ratio  
})  
```  

#### 1. Adaptation for third-party payment pages:  
- Mobile: Full-screen Web component  
- PC: Embedded iframe + independent operation area  
```typescript  
if (breakpoint === 'lg') {  
  this.useIframeMode = true  
}  
```  


### IV. Layout Secrets of the Card Package Module  
#### 1. Card waterfall flow layout:  
```typescript  
GridCol({  
  span: {sm:12, md:6, lg:4} // Display 1/2/3 columns on three devices  
}) {  
  BankCardComponent()  
}  
```  

#### 1. Interaction differences for adding bank cards:  
- Mobile: Bottom pop-up  
- Tablet: Right slide-out  
- PC: Centered dialog box  
```typescript  
promptAction.showModal({  
  alignment: deviceType === 'phone' ?  
    Alignment.Bottom : Alignment.Center  
})  
```  


### V. Development Tips  
1. Write breakpoint listening in the `aboutToAppear` lifecycle.  
2. Use `Blank` components to fill empty areas for greater flexibility.  
3. Make good use of the `@Extend` decorator to reuse styles.  
4. Multi-device preview shortcut key: `Ctrl+Shift+M`.  


### Conclusion:  
These official cases are like martial arts cheats—mastering them truly enables "writing code once, automatically adapting to all devices"! It is recommended that you create a new project in the IDE and try these code snippets personally; you will definitely feel like打通任督二脉 (unlocking key development channels)!
